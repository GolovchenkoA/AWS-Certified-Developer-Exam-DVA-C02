# Section 2 AWS Accounts and IAM

## 8 AWS Account and Budget
- Account. Add alias
- enable MFA
- Account. Activate AM user and role access to Billing information
- Billing preferences. Alert preferences. Recieve AWS Free Tier Alerts
-  Budgets. create a monthly budget
- Cost Explorer

## 9 AWS IAM

- Identity-based policy and Resoure-base policy
- User, User Groups, Role, Policy
- Identity-based policy is applied to user, groups and roles
- Roles are used for delegation and are assumed
- [IAM ARNs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_identifiers.html#identifiers-arns). User example: arn:aws:iam::account:user/UserName
- Users gain the **permissions** applied to the group through the **policy**
- Authentication: AWS IAM, CLI, API
- The root user has Full unrestricted permissions. IAM Users are restricted by IAM Policies (by default everything is restricted)

## Authentication
- Console Management (login\pass + MFA)
- CLI, API (access key ID and secreat access key)
- AWS Security Token Service (STS)

When an app try to access a resource, credentials include:
- AccessKeyId
- Expiration
- SecretAccessKey
- SessionToken

Temporaary credentials are used with:
- identity federation
- delegation
- cross-account access
- IAM roles

Access control methods:
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)

## 14. Access control methods. RBAC & ABAC
**RBAC** 

AWS job function policies. Are designed to closely align to common job functions in the IT industy.

- Administrator
- Billing
- DB administrator
- Data scientist
- Developer power user
- Network administrator
- sercurity auditor
- support user
- Sys. administrator
- View-only user


**ABAC** 

Key\Value tag is assigned to resources.

Example:

DBadmins group is allowed to start, strop and reboot DBs in production.

We have a user that has key\value tag as Departemtn\DBAdmins.
Our resources (Amazon RDS for example) have tags Environment\Production and Environment\Development.
Then we create an ABAC policy:
```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowDBAdminProdActions",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "rds:StartDBInstance",
        "rds:StopDBInstance",
        "rds:RebootDBInstance"
      ],
      "Resource": "*",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "aws:ResourceTag/Environment": "Production",
          "aws:PrincipalTag/Department": "DBadmin"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## 15. Swithing IAM Roles
It might be useful if we need to do critical operations time to time and should have the permission all the time by default. 

[Methods to assume a role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_manage-assume.html)

[Grant a user permissions to switch roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_permissions-to-switch.html)

# Section 5. Amazon S3 and Cloud Front

[General purpose bucket naming rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/bucketnamingrules.html)

## 45. Permissions and Bucket Policies
Examples can be found [here](https://github.com/nealdct/aws-dva-code/tree/main/amazon-s3/permissions-lesson)

## 46. Versioning, Replication and Lifecycle Rules

- Cross-Region Replication (CRR)
- Same-Region Replication (SRR)

Also replication can be:
- live replication
- batch replication

CRR and SRR can be done not only within a single account, but also between 2 different accounts.

**S3 Lifecycle Management. 2 types of actions:**
- Transition actions - Define when objects transition to anoter storage class
- Expiration actions - Define when objects expire (deleted by s3)

 ‚ö†Ô∏è  The sliedes have a schema how files can and cannot migrate between the storage classes.


## 47. Configure Replication and LIfecycle

[S3 Replication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/replication.html)
[S3 Replication. How to setup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/replication-how-setup.html)
[S3 Replication. Replicate Data within and between AWS Regions](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/replicate-data-using-amazon-s3-replication/?ref=docs_gateway/amazons3/replication-example-walkthroughs.html)


- Source and destinatin buckets were created. 
- Policies -> Create -> Custom Trust Policy. Policy name: SRR-S3 (Same Region Replication policy) created. [See example](https://github.com/nealdct/aws-dva-code/blob/main/amazon-s3/s3-trust-policy.json)
- Create a role for the policy. It will be used by the replication rule (see next step) Choose SRR-S3 policy -> add permisstions -> add [this example](https://github.com/nealdct/aws-dva-code/blob/main/amazon-s3/s3-replication-permissions.json). Role name the same as the policy name "SRR-S3"
- Creating a replication rule (name: SRR-S3) for the source bucket. Open the bucket -> Management -> create replication rule.

  At this point replication should work.

We also can create a `Lifecycle rule` to move files between storage classes. To do that open the source bucket -> Management -> Create `Lifecycle rule` and investigate the available settings there.

 ‚ö†Ô∏è  If versioning is enabled for a bucket - you can see all updated or deleted fieles there (just turn on the toggle)


 ## 48. MFA with S3
 Usefult for:
 - chenging version state for a bucket
 - permanently deleting an object bersion (MFA Delete)

MFA-Protected API Access

üìù For additional information see the Slides


## 49. S3 Encryption

[How to protect you data using encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingEncryption.html)

 ‚ö†Ô∏è 
```
!!!!!!!!! Important
Amazon S3 now applies server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) as the base level of encryption for every bucket in Amazon S3. Starting January 5, 2023, all new object uploads to Amazon S3 are automatically encrypted at no additional cost and with no impact on performance. The automatic encryption status for S3 bucket default encryption configuration and for new object uploads is available in AWS CloudTrail logs, S3 Inventory, S3 Storage Lens, the Amazon S3 console, and as an additional Amazon S3 API response header in the AWS Command Line Interface and AWS SDKs. For more information, see Default encryption FAQ.
```

- Server side encryption with S3 managed keys (SSE-S3 )
- Server-side encryption with AWS KMS managed keys (SSE-KMS)
- Server-Side encryption with client provided keys (SSE-C)
- Client-side encryption

The policies can be chose when we upload a file on S3 (from UI)

üìù For additional information see the Slides

## 50 Enforce Encryption with AWS KMS..

[Deny bucket policy example](https://github.com/nealdct/aws-dva-code/blob/main/amazon-s3/s3-enforce-kms-encryption.json).Force to use `aws:kms`. Deny if `s3:x-am2-server-side-encryption` field value in PUT s3 object request is not `aws:kms`



## 51. S3 Event Notifications

[Amazon S3 Event Notifications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/EventNotifications.html)

‚ö†Ô∏è S3 Events designed to be delivered at least once

Destinations:
- SNS
- SQS
- Lambdas

[Granting permissions to publish event notification messages to a destination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/grant-destinations-permissions-to-s3.html)


## 52. S2 Presigned URLs

[Sharing objects with presigned URLs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/ShareObjectPreSignedURL.html)

By default, all Amazon S3 objects are private, only the object owner has permission to access them. However, the object owner may share objects with others by creating a presigned URL. A presigned URL uses security credentials to grant time-limited permission to download objects. The URL can be entered in a browser or used by a program to download the object.

CLI example
```
aws s3 presign s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/mydoc.txt --expires-in 604800
```


## 53. Server Access Logging

[Enabling Amazon S3 server access logging](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/enable-server-access-logging.html)

- Only pay for the storage space used
- most configs store events in a separate bucket
- Must grant write permissins to the `Amazon S3 Log Delivery` group on the destionation bucket


## 54 CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)

`origin` - DNS name you are connectiong to using your client

[Using cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/cors.html)


## 55. S2 Performance

‚ö†Ô∏è S3 Events designed to be delivered at least once
Amazon S3 automatically scales to high request rates. For example, your application can achieve at least 

- 3,500 PUT/COPY/POST/DELETE
-  or 5,500 GET/HEAD requests per second per partitioned Amazon S3 prefix.

There are no limits to the number of prefixes in a bucket. You can increase your read or write performance by using parallelization. For example, if you create 10 prefixes in an Amazon S3 bucket to parallelize reads, you could scale your read performance to 55,000 read requests per second. Similarly, you can scale write operations by writing to multiple prefixes. See 
[Best practices design patterns: optimizing Amazon S3 performance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/optimizing-performance.html)

üéØ Use `Amazon S3 Transfer ASccelerator` to increase uploads over long distances.
‚ö†Ô∏è Buckets used with Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration can't have periods (.) in their names.

[Byte-range fetches](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/optimizing-performance-guidelines.html) use the Range HTTP header to transer only specified byte-range from an object


## CloudFront Origins and Destinations

[CloudFront use cases](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/IntroductionUseCases.html)
[CloudFront](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/website-hosting-cloudfront-walkthrough.html)

Edge Locations - locations where the data is cached.

[Use various origins with CloudFront distributions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/DownloadDistS3AndCustomOrigins.html)

When we create a CloudFront Distribution can have multiple origins. An `origin` (s3) and `custom origin` (EC2 for example).


Using Lambda@Edge with CloudFront enables a variety of ways to customize the content that CloudFront delivers. To learn more about Lambda@Edge and how to create and deploy functions with CloudFront, see Customize at the edge with [Lambda@Edge](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/lambda-at-the-edge.html). To see a number of code samples that you can customize for your own solutions, see Lambda@Edge example functions.


## 57. CloudFront Signed URL and OAI/OAC

[Signed URLs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-signed-urls.html)

A signed URL includes additional information, for example, an expiration date and time, that gives you more control over access to your content. This additional information appears in a policy statement, which is based on either a canned policy or a custom policy. The differences between canned and custom policies are explained in the next two sections.

‚ö†Ô∏è Signed URLs should be used for `individual files` and clients that don't support cooies


[CloudFront Signed Cookies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-signed-cookies.html)

- Similar to Signed URLs
-  Use singed cookies when you don't want to change URLs
-  can also be used when you want to provide access to `multiple resticred files`


[OAI Origin Access Identity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/cloudfront-origin-access-identity-enabled.html). ‚ö†Ô∏è OAI is Deprecated. OAC is recommended
OAI works only for S3. When it's configured (Policy applied to an 'origin' bucket) then user can only call the origin through CloudFront, and cannot call the bucket directly

[OAC Origin Access Control](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/amazon-cloudfront-introduces-origin-access-control-oac/)
OAC is an improvement version of OAI with additional use cases.


## 58. CloudFront Cache and Behavior Settings

[Amazon CloudFront Cache and Behavior Settings](https://github.com/nealdct/aws-dva-code/blob/main/amazon-cloudfront/cloudfront-cache-and-behavior.md)

CloudShell -> us-east-1 -> 
```
aws s3 mb s3://art-statitc-website-12345
aws s3 mb s3://art-pdf-bucket-12345
aws s3 mb s3://art-jpg-bucket-12345
```

Apply bucket policy to `your_bucket_name`

```
{
	"Version": "2012-10-17",
	"Statement": [
		{
			"Sid": "Statement1",
			"Principal": "*",
			"Effect": "Allow",
			"Action": [
				"s3:GetObject"
			],
			"Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your_bucket_name/*"
		}
	]
}
```


- Create a CloudFront distribution. 
- Add origins for all 3 buckets (main, jpeg, pdf). Where `main` is public and `jpeg` and `pdf` use OAC.
- When jpeg/pdf distribution is created -> copy the generated bucket policy and apply it to the corresponding bucket.

Generated policy example:
The policy says that Principal: CloudFront is allowed to GetObjects from S3 when  source ARN is equal to the destibution
```
{
        "Version": "2008-10-17",
        "Id": "PolicyForCloudFrontPrivateContent",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Sid": "AllowCloudFrontServicePrincipal",
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Principal": {
                    "Service": "cloudfront.amazonaws.com"
                },
                "Action": "s3:GetObject",
                "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your_bucket_name_here/*",
                "Condition": {
                    "StringEquals": {
                      "AWS:SourceArn": "arn:aws:cloudfront::123456789:distribution/GENERATED_DISTRIBUTiON_CODE"
                    }
                }
            }
        ]
      }
```
