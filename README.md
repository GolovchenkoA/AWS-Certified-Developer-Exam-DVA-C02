## 9 AWS IAM

- Identity-based policy and Resoure-base policy
- User, User Groups, Role, Policy
- Identity-based policy is applied to user, groups and roles
- Roles are used for delegation and are assumed
- [IAM ARNs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_identifiers.html#identifiers-arns). User example: arn:aws:iam::account:user/UserName
- Users gain the **permissions** applied to the group through the **policy**
- Authentication: AWS IAM, CLI, API
- The root user has Full unrestricted permissions. IAM Users are restricted by IAM Policies (by default everything is restricted)

## Authentication
- Console Management (login\pass + MFA)
- CLI, API (access key ID and secreat access key)
- AWS Security Token Service (STS)

When an app try to access a resource, credentials include:
- AccessKeyId
- Expiration
- SecretAccessKey
- SessionToken

Temporaary credentials are used with:
- identity federation
- delegation
- cross-account access
- IAM roles

Access control methods:
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)

**RBAC** AWS job function policies. Are designed to closely align to common job functions in the IT industy.
- Administrator
- Billing
- DB administrator
- Data scientist
- Developer power user
- Network administrator
- sercurity auditor
- support user
- Sys. administrator
- View-only user


**ABAC** Key\Value tag is assigned to resources.
Example:

DBadmins group is allowed to start, strop and reboot DBs in production.

We have a user that has key\value tag as Departemtn\DBAdmins.
Our resources (Amazon RDS for example) have tags Environment\Production and Environment\Development.
Then we create an ABAC policy:
```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowDBAdminProdActions",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "rds:StartDBInstance",
        "rds:StopDBInstance",
        "rds:RebootDBInstance"
      ],
      "Resource": "*",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "aws:ResourceTag/Environment": "Production",
          "aws:PrincipalTag/Department": "DBadmin"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
